# PSP Ut03Ex01:

# In this exercise, we implement retrofit, so that we can get alarms from an api, but in this case the domain is not only formed by one data class, because Alert contains not only a statuscode but also a list of data, that is defined apart, the data, also contains different attributes. We also defined two models one to get the data of a concrete Status code and the other one with the alerts list
